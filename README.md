Place to share my homework for JS academy

Questions to figure out:

[1] What is the common structure for node project? Where do tests live?

[2] How to make IntelliJ better support testing? Example
    - jumping from file to the corresponding tests file (shift + ctr + T for java)
    - running one specific test at the time (right now I can only run the entire test file)


[3] There are a lots of weird warnings in Intellij like
    - unterminated statement for 'use strict' line
    - unresolvable variable "to" in test
